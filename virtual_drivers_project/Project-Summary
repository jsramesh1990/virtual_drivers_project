How to Use:
Build everything:

bash
make all
Install drivers:

bash
sudo make install
Run applications:

bash
# Character device advanced app
sudo ./apps/char_app

# Block device advanced app
sudo ./apps/block_app

# Unified control panel
sudo ./apps/unified_app
Command-line testing:

bash
# Run character benchmark
sudo ./apps/char_app --bench

# Show block device info
